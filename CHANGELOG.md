## solved
- can have 2 render and each has it proper updater
- render accepts selector '#'
- createTag allows missing props as first pararmenter, both in preact and react
- hyper-helpers not needed as external dep, integrated in act.js
- stateful component without hooks and classes
- $data auto reactive in component opts
- class translated to className if using react, so no warning
- inline style text to object to react
- external reactive object (update all updates generated by renders)

## todo
- translate: combo, table, waterfall example
- other tags: notification, drawer, modal, responsive menu
- redux store
- router

## long todo
- include preact hooks?
- automate switch from react to preact on prod?
- using with bundlers (esm import?)

## hyperhelper goodies
- less ${``} than htm
- everyting is function, code validation, type checking
- comments (just code)
- createTag allows to custom syntax transformation
